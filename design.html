<p> General knowledge and any web design article agree that keeping it simple is best wwhen it comes to websites. The main priority is to capture visitors' attention span with simple geometric shapes, bright colors, and good margins, so that they can get the important imformation and get out. I spent a significant portion of my time trying to implement a double parallax background for my site, before I realized that just poses too many confusing aesthetics and stuck to a two-tone on a city backdrop. On my CSS page, I chose four primary colors that I though contrasted well, applied them across all my headers and elements where appropriate, and ended up with a two-tone design that oddly looks like a Campbell soup can. Either way, I think it looks simple enough.
 Although the articles don't talk about it directly, "card designs" seem to be a popular UX feature these days, so I tried to portray my bulk of information inside a "card", which is seen as two different colors. To balance how squarish it looks, I added a few small elements in the form of small colored circles to balance off the design while keeping it simple. A lot of time was also spent playing around with margins and making sure they worked on a fine scale.
 I topped the design off with interactive elements, such as hover links as well as an implementation for a profile picture that goes from grayscale to color on hover.
 A challenge I faced was trying to put together a responsive UI design without relying on bootstrap, and gave it a shot with multiple if statements to correspond with four different but common resolutions. It turned out to be too much of a mess so I scrapped it, so my site looks like the equivalent of a sad, broken campbell soup can on a mobile device, unfortunately. I also really loathe the fact that I didn't get to spend as much time on this as I would like (the deadlines and activities just never stop coming (:( :( :(), and I would have definitely liked to use more creative frameworks out there to make this a much, much better website than it is now.
